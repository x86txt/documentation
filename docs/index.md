### Hi and welcome to my document and how-to repository. 

This repo is a personal passion project. It contains things I've run into and wanted to document for future reference as well as with the intention of sharing knowledge with anyone who may find themselves deep into Google trying to solve the same problem.

If you'd like to contact me, check out the social links at the bottom right of the page, or feel free to leave a comment on any of the pages where they are enabled.
